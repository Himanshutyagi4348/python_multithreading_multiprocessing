Python Concurrency Demo
Explore how to use multithreading and multiprocessing in Python, complete with performance comparisons for I/O-bound vs CPU-bound tasks.

üß© What's Inside
üîπ Multithreading

Uses ThreadPoolExecutor from concurrent.futures to run lightweight threads within a single process

Ideal for I/O-bound operations like file reads or web requests

Threads share memory but are limited by Python‚Äôs Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), meaning only one thread runs bytecode at any moment

‚öôÔ∏è Multiprocessing

Leveraging multiprocessing.Pool, this module spawns separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space

Enables true parallel execution across multiple CPU cores‚Äîperfect for compute-heavy tasks

üöÄ How to Use
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo
cd your-repo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run I/O-bound example
python io_thread_example.py

# Run CPU-bound benchmark
python cpu_process_benchmark.py
‚úÖ Key Takeaways
Scenario	Best Approach	Why
I/O-bound tasks	Multithreading	Overlaps waiting time, plus thread pooling reduces overhead
